There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, but Elon Musk cares about only one – X. That's the new name of Twitter , but the change ran into an unexpected problem. Apple's App Store platform has an unwritten rule that app names should be at least two characters long.
The app has also been renamed to X on the Google Play Store . However, as you may have already heard, the X logo on top of the company's San Francisco headquarters has been removed.
X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we're just beginning to imagine.
It's yet to be seen whether this rebranding is a smart idea or not – Twitter was a household name, after all. Even Google and Facebook kept the names of their most popular products when they reorganized into Alphabet and Meta, respectively. It's not just the site/app name either, the word "tweet" had entered common usage, but it has now been replaced by the generic "post".
